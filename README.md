# A basic To-do app made using reactjs, ocntext api and local storage

Here I am using tailwind css and vite to create our react js app.

## Introduction

This is a basic to-do app which is used to manage tasks and helps an individual to enhance his/her productivity.

## How to use ?

Once you open this app you will see an input field just below "Manage your Todos". You need to type your task there and click on add button to add that task to your task list. After you have added you can tick mark the task as completed and also edit the task by clicking on pencil icon near rightmost section. Also, to clear the screen you can delete task by clicking on cross button.

## Techstack

The basic purpose of making this app is to understand the context api , props drilling and local storage concept. As framewrok, I have used React js (vite) as a template and tailwind css for styling.
